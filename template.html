        <p>It's not dead, but the normal way to access it (<code>messenger.hotmail.com:1863</code>) will get you connection refused.</p>
        <p>In theory this means MSN is now HTTPS only, but the all the internal servers seem to have port 1863 open still</p>
        <p>Alternatives:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enable http method. Most servers support this (all of them if HTTPS). (<a href="#pidgin-http-method">FAQ entry for pidgin</a>)</li>
            <li>Pick one working IP randomly from the lists below and tell your client to connect to it. (<a href="#connection-refused">FAQ entry</a>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Also, keep your clients up to date!</p>

    <h3>What about all the news saying it's gone?  <a href="#what-about-all-the-news-saying-its-gone" name="what-about-all-the-news-saying-its-gone" class="anchor">#</a></h3>
    <p>That's partly because nobody does fact checking and partly because the criteria of "dead" here is more oriented to third party clients</p>
    <p>It was supposed to die in march 2013. The only thing that changed was a forced upgrade of the official clients to skype. Before mid-november 2014 the only issue was that offline messages and mail notifications didn't work.</p>
    <p>Right now it <em>seems</em> like it might be dying, so I made this to track the progress of its death.</p>
    <h3>Getting connection refused  <a href="#connection-refused" name="connection-refused" class="anchor">#</a></h3>
    <p>Try switching to http method</p>
    <p>If your client doesn't support http method, you can try setting the server address to one of the working IPs from above</p>
    <p>One way to set the server address is to edit your <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hosts_%28file%29">hosts file</a> and assign it to <code>messenger.hotmail.com</code> by adding a line like this:</p>
    <pre>134.170.24.231 messenger.hotmail.com</pre>
    <p>Remember to change that IP - overloaded servers may redirect you back to the broken ones!</p>

    <h3>How do I switch to HTTP method in pidgin? <a href="#pidgin-http-method" name="pidgin-http-method" class="anchor">#</a></h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In the accounts window, click modify</li>
        <li>Go to the advanced tab</li>
        <li>Check "use http method"</li>
        <li><b>Change HTTP Method Server</b> to one of the working IP addresses above, as pidgin doesn't connect through HTTPS</li>
    </ol>
    <p>That's all. All the other fields are irrelevant and can be left as-is</p>
    <img src="http://dump.dequis.org/IHmDR.png" alt="" class="center-block img-responsive" />

    <h3>Some contacts are offline  <a href="#some-contacts-are-offline" name="some-contacts-are-offline" class="anchor">#</a></h3>
    <p>Might be a pidgin bug that sneaked in the last release. Try removing that contact and adding it again</p>
    <p>If everything fails, <a href="http://outlook.com">outlook.com</a> has a webchat (using MSNP24!), any msn login will work</p>

    <h3>How do I fix my BitlBee? <a href="#bitlbee" name="bitlbee" class="anchor">#</a></h3>
    <p><b>Native BitlBee</b>: Doesn't support HTTP method (I'm working on it, okay!)</p>
    <p>If you're using revision 1070, just do:</p>
    <pre>account msn set server 134.170.24.231</pre>
    <p>If you're using revision 1064, edit your hosts file as suggested in a previous question. If you're using something older, it won't work because of the ApplicationID block. Except, maybe, 1.x, but please don't.</p>
    <p><b>bitlbee-libpurple</b>: Enable http method like this:</p>
    <pre>account msn set http_method on</pre>
    <p>Also get libpurple 2.10.11 or it won't work because of the ApplicationID block.</p>
    <p><b>Public servers</b>: testing.bitlbee.org usually runs the latest version and should work.</p>

    <h3>Why care about MSN? <a href="#why-care-about-msn" name="why-care-about-msn" class="anchor">#</a></h3>
    <p>A few reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>It's a decent bridge to the skype network</li>
        <li>Works in clients that aren't skype</li>
        <li><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/253030/" class="sneaky">I like the idea of delaying the inevitable by catching energy boosts which reverse the setting sun - if only for a moment</a></li>
        <li>Fun things are fun</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What does the future hold? <a href="#what-does-the-future-hold" name="what-does-the-future-hold" class="anchor">#</a></h3>
    <p>This is speculation, but based on the current trends, it will keep breaking slowly, based on what microsoft doesn't need to keep alive anymore</p>
    <p>The HTTP(S) method (port 443 in the status table above) is likely to stay up. These servers are still used by skype, although with a newer protocol.</p>
    <p>The messaging client included in windows 8.0 (which they probably still need to support) uses a MSNP22 - a protocol version older than skype's, newer than most other third party clients, but using the same connection method as the older ones, through HTTPS</p>
